# 📱 Phone Contact Manager - Python Beginner's Toolkit

## 1. Title & Objective

Technology Chosen: Python 3 Programming Language

Why I Chose It: Python has clean, readable syntax perfect for beginners. I wanted to build something practical that demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) which are fundamental to all software applications.

End Goal: Create a command-line phonebook application where users can add contacts, view all contacts, search by name, edit existing contacts, delete contacts, and view statistics.

 2. Quick Summary of the Technology

What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability with its use of significant whitespace and English-like syntax.

Where is it used?
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science & machine learning
- Automation & scripting
- Desktop applications

Real-world example: Instagram's backend handles millions of requests daily using Python and Django.

7. Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue                          | Error/Symptom                 | Solution                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permission Denied              | `PermissionError: [Errno 13]` | Use `python3 phonebook.py` instead of `./phonebook.py`                 |
| Python not found               | `command not found: python`   | Use `python3` explicitly (Kali default)                                |
| Virtual env not activating     | `source: not found`           | Run `bash` first, or use `. venv/bin/activate`                         |
| Search finds nothing           | No results displayed          | Check spelling - search is case-insensitive but checks exact substring |
| Cannot edit contact            | "Contact not found"           | View contacts first to get correct ID number                           |
| Phone validation fails         | "Invalid phone number"        | Remove spaces/dashes - digits only, minimum 10 characters              |

Kali Linux Specific:

# If python command defaults to Python 2, always use:
python3 phonebook.py

# Or create alias in ~/.bashrc:
echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
